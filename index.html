                        <p>Ensure your family is safe first. Turn off electricity at the mains if it is safe to do so. Do not walk through standing water near electrical outlets. Call iDry on 0800 452 199 immediately — the sooner water extraction begins, the less damage to your property. Avoid moving wet items or using household vacuums on floodwater.</p>

                        <p>Yes. In Auckland's humid climate, mould can begin colonising within 24–48 hours of water exposure. Professional water extraction and structural drying are essential to prevent mould growth. iDry includes antimicrobial treatment as part of every flood restoration to protect against secondary mould damage.</p>
