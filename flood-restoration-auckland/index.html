                        <p>Yes. In Auckland's humid climate, mould can begin colonising within 24–48 hours of water exposure. Professional water extraction and structural drying are essential to prevent mould growth. iDry includes antimicrobial treatment as standard in every flood restoration job to protect your property from secondary mould damage.</p>

                        <p>It depends on the severity of the flooding. Minor flooding in one room may not require you to leave. Significant flooding affecting multiple rooms, or situations where electricity must be turned off, often require temporary relocation. If your insurance policy includes temporary accommodation cover, iDry can help coordinate this as part of your claim.</p>
