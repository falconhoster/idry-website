                                <p>Meth residue causes headaches, respiratory problems, skin irritation, nausea, and sleep disturbance. Children are most vulnerable due to smaller body weight and hand-to-mouth contact.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The only reliable way to confirm meth contamination is through professional testing. A certified sampler takes surface swab samples from multiple areas of the property, which are then analysed by an IANZ-accredited laboratory. Visual signs can include yellow or brown staining on walls and ceilings, chemical odours, and stained extraction fans, but many contaminated properties show no visible signs at all. iDry provides NZS 8510 compliant meth testing across Auckland.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>NZS 8510:2017 is the New Zealand Standard for testing and decontamination of methamphetamine-contaminated properties. It sets the acceptable level of methamphetamine residue at 1.5 micrograms per 100cm&sup2; for properties used as dwellings. The standard covers testing procedures, decontamination methods, validation testing, and clearance certification. All meth testing and decontamination by iDry follows this standard.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Costs vary depending on contamination levels and the size of the property. A preliminary meth test typically costs $300&ndash;$600. Decontamination of a lightly contaminated property may cost $3,000&ndash;$8,000, while heavily contaminated properties where meth was manufactured can cost $15,000&ndash;$50,000 or more. iDry provides detailed quotes after testing confirms contamination levels. Some insurance policies cover meth decontamination costs.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes. Methamphetamine residue absorbs into walls, ceilings, carpets, curtains, and other porous surfaces. Occupants are exposed through skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Health effects include headaches, respiratory problems, skin irritation, nausea, and sleep disturbance. Children are especially vulnerable due to their smaller body weight and tendency to touch surfaces and put hands in their mouths. Properties where meth was manufactured pose the highest risk due to additional toxic chemicals.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>DIY meth test kits are available but have significant limitations. They provide only a positive or negative result for a single spot, cannot quantify contamination levels, may produce false positives, and are not accepted by insurers, banks, or property managers. Professional testing under NZS 8510 uses IANZ-accredited laboratories, provides exact contamination levels per room, and produces a legally recognised report suitable for insurance claims, property transactions, and Tenancy Tribunal proceedings.</p>

                        <p>The timeline depends on contamination levels and property size. A standard decontamination of a lightly contaminated 3-bedroom home typically takes 3&ndash;5 days. This includes initial cleaning, sealing of surfaces, and validation testing. Heavily contaminated properties or former meth labs may require removal of carpets, curtains, plasterboard, and insulation, extending the timeline to 2&ndash;4 weeks. iDry provides a clear timeline after the initial assessment and testing results.</p>

                        <p>While not legally required for all property sales, meth testing is strongly recommended as part of due diligence.

                        <p>In cases where meth has been manufactured (as opposed to just used), contamination can spread through shared walls, ventilation systems, and common areas in multi-unit dwellings. If you live in an apartment, unit, or townhouse and a neighbouring property has tested positive, testing your own unit is recommended. iDry can test and decontaminate individual units or entire complexes.</p>
